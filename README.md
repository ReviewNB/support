## What is ReviewNB?
Having trouble using Jupyter Notebook in a team workflow? Version control, code reviews and collaboration are difficult with Jupyter Notebooks.

ReviewNB makes Notebooks a first class entity in Data Science & ML teams by providing:

* Visual diff for every GitHub commit or Pull Request containing Notebooks

* Commenting on the Notebook diff to review Jupyter Notebook PRs

ReviewNB provides a complete code review workflow for Jupyter Notebooks on GitHub. You can ask clarifying questions, suggest improvements & open/close issues before approving the PR.

(Coming Soon) A CI pipeline for Jupyter Notebooks to continuously test each change and its effect on your experiment/analysis.
