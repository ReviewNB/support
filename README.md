## What is ReviewNB?

Having trouble using Jupyter Notebooks in your team? Version control, code reviews and collaboration is difficult with Jupyter Notebooks. 

ReviewNB provides a complete code review workflow for Jupyter Notebooks on GitHub.

- [Visual diff ](https://tinyurl.com/yxvokoew) for every GitHub commit or Pull Request containing Notebooks

- [Commenting](https://tinyurl.com/y648jktr) on the Notebook diff to review Jupyter Notebook PRs. 

- You can ask clarifying questions, suggest improvements & open/close issues before approving the PR. 

- (Coming Soon) A CI pipeline for Jupyter Notebooks to continuously test each change. See [treon](https://github.com/ReviewNB/treon), our open source library for notebook testing.

Our aim is to make Notebooks a first class entity in Data Science & ML teams.
